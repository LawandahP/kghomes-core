You are a powerful Ai model and would like your comprehensive thought on creating a rental management system

Typically this system should be able to manage rental property with tenants in it.

It should be able to manage landlords, tenants, properties, units, leases invoces and payments

Now I am writing this in django and django rest framework and would like a comprehensive model structure and relationships of the whole projet to make it easier

Do not give vade responses but they should be detailed and comprehensive. Especially on the lease invoice and payment parts and how they can be incorporated in the project

full description of how the models with appropriate fields should also be included. Thank you.
